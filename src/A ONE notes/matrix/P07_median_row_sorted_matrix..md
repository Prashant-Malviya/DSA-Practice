## 📌 Problem Statement

 we are given an odd size matrix and every row is sorted in increasing order, find the median of the matrix

I/p:-
{
    {1 10 20},
    {15 25 35},
    {5 30 40}
}

o/p:- 20 [1,5,10,15,20*,25,30,35,40]

Assumption: -> Odd sized matrix
            -> All Distinct Elements

## 💡 Key Intuition

## 🧾 Approach

1. Naive Solution: O(rc)

- (1) Put all elements in an array [O(r*c)]
- sort the array [(r*c log r*c)]
- return the middle element of the sorted array [O(1)]


2. Efficient Soln: O(r*log(max-min)*logC)
